Welcome to the TypeScript fundamentals course. This course will cover everything from data types and some medium-advanced JavaScript all the way up to generics, type guards and more.

It wil built to aid me teaching a friend of mine the language but I thought I would share it open source as well. The course assumes a basic understanding of programming principles and the basics of JavaScript. If you've not learnt JavaScript before, this course might not be for you.

To get started, head to `course/introduction.md`
